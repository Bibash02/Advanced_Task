# Basic File Encryption/Decryption
A Python-based application that allows users to secure text files by encrypting and decrypting them using Fernet symmetric encryption. 
This project demonstrates basic cryptography concepts, file handling, and secure data storage in Python.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

cryptography (Fernet)

Built-in Python modules: os

🔐 Encryption Algorithm

This project uses Fernet encryption, which:

Is a symmetric encryption algorithm

Uses a single secret key for both encryption and decryption

Ensures data confidentiality and integrity
